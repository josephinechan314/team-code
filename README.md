# Purpose
Hey Sabers! This is the shared repository (aka "repo") that we will use to manage the code throughout the 2024-2025 FIRST DIVE season.

# Using GitHub
GitHub is an online platform that programmers use to share code. It shouldn't be confused with git, which is a memory card that comes pre-installed on all Mac computers (Windows users will need to add it manually).

To get a copy of the code onto your computer, open a new terminal and go into whatever folder you want to put the code in. Then, run the command "git clone" followed by the repo's URL, which you can find by pressing the green "Code" button at the top right of the repo. You should now have a copy of the code stored locally on your computer!

Now let's say you add some code and want to upload your new version of the code onto GitHub so everyone has access to it. To do this, run the following commands:
 * git add . --> Saves your edited version of the code. If you only want to save a certain part of the code, you can replace the period with the file name you changed (best to just save everything, though).
 * git commit -m "describe changes here" --> Commits the code to memory and allows you any changes you make so people can understand precisely what you changed. As you can imagine, this makes it easy for one programmer to pick off exactly where the other programmer left off!
 * git push --> This pushes the newest version of the code onto GitHub for everyone to see. You can still access older versions of the code by pressing the "Commits" button, which can be found right below the Code button.

To get the newest version of the code from GitHub, run the command "git pull".

Still confused? That's completely fine! GitHub can take a while to get used to. Here are some great video resources to help you get started:

# Closing Remarks
That's all for now! I know we will do amazing things as a team, and I hope that GitHub helps us get there!

Love,
